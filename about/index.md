## Professionally

I'm a web developer, which is to say I reduce risk, extend capability, and
increase awareness by writing software with [HTTP-centric
interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

Software of that kind is understandable as a
[distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing)
information-processing system, which makes it well-suited to helping
organizations achieve their goals, since organizations are _also_ distributed
information-processing systems.

## Unprofessionally

I have studied philosophy, learned paragliding, and played at least 40
different role-playing games.
