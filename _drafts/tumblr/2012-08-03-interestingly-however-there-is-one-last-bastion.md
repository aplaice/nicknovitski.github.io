title: 'Interestingly, however, there is one last bastion of economic activity that
  proved remarkably resistant to the triumph of the market: firms, companies and,
  later, corporations. Think about it: market-societies, or capitalism, are synonymous
  with firms, companies, corporations. And yet, quite paradoxically, firms can be
  thought of as market-free zones. Within their realm, firms (like societies) allocate
  scarce resources (between different productive activities and processes). Nevertheless
  they do so by means of some non-price, more often than not hierarchical, mechanism!'
