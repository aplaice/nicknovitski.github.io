I’m testing a Ruby gem that I’m writing to import Blogger blogs.  It looks like ~130 old posts won’t disrupt anyone’s feeds or dashboards, (as long as I disable ‘send to twitter’ for the duration), but if I turn out to be wrong, then I do apologize and hope you won’t hold it against me until you read how dumb some of these old posts are.
