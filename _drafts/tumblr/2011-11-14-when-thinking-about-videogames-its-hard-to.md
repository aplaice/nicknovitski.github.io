title: When thinking about videogames it’s hard to separate the momentary effect on
  a player from the meaning of the experience. In the preceding decade, with its increasing
  complexity and clashing collision of systems, expressive experimentation and undisciplined
  sentimentality defined games. Designers found ways to make mechanics for bra removal
  and defecation while players basked in manful sorrow and self-congratulation. In
  seeking to elevate difficulty as the primary expressive tool for designers Rohrer
  is calling for a more rigorous approach to theme and meaning, rejecting the idea
  that a game’s consumability equates to its canonical worth.
