Curio and Co - Finding Frank and FriendI met these folks at Wondercon, and I hereby give them the Nick Novitski “Work Most Likely to Inspire a Scene in a William Gibson Novel” Award.
Their product, by far the most shocking I saw at the show, was a collection of draft artwork and unpublished strips for the beloved classic comic strip Frank and Friend, rescued from the garage where they had lain collecting dust since creator Francis Dooley passed away, restored and presented to an adoring public for the first time, complete with commentary and anecdotes from family and friends, all of which is completely made up because the book was actually made by one guy who decided to make a product with a fictional history.
The book takes as a given that everyone who bothers to read it knows all about the published Frank and Friend: the corpus is collected in other (purely notional) books.  What you get here is a peek inside the mind of the master.  There are drafts of particularly well-liked strips, showing adjustments to poses and layouts, notes from editors, rewording of the dialogue.   There are unused strips.  There are sketches and cartoons made for the fake-real children who inspired the fake-fictional eponymous star of the strip (“Friend” is a mute stuffed animal).  
And not only did the “real” author create precise drawings to resemble hasty, repeatedly drawn-and-erased sketches, he also added all the marks and damage you’d expect to find on papers that lay in a garage for 30 years.  Coffee rings, yellowing, water stains… every page is redolent with a 100% manufactured history.
I asked the author what on earth inspired him to do this, and he charitably misunderstood me, instead answering “What works did you draw on for inspiration while making this?”  And the answer is, of course, “real” collections of unpublished artwork.  He liked those, so he decided to make one.  What could be simpler?
Then he described the spreadsheet he needed to use to keep track of the intersecting lives of the various characters whose history with Dooley are mentioned in passing by the book
I was able to tell him that there was actually a word for what he had made: a pragmaclast, an object with a notional history which conflicts with that of everything around it.  No one, looking at the book, can doubt that its origins lie in a world where Frank and Friend and Clarence Dooley are real, and yet, when we look around, that is not the world that we see.
Before, I had only used the word to refer to bits in the better time-travel stories.  I never thought I would ever see and hold one.  Somewhat foolishly, It never occurred to me that they could be real, physical, marketable objects.
