A funky song on Liz Berg’s podcast suddenly reminded me of the Just So Story about how the elephant lost his trunk, and how surprisingly progressive it is.
Elephants used to have distinctive snouts, but much shorter, just like the tapir.  There was once a young elephant who was very curious, and always asked his parents, and various “uncles and aunts” (other animals) why everything was the way it was.  Why do melons taste that way, why do things this way.
It takes a savannah to raise a child, and as if they had agreed about it ahead of time, his parents and aunts and uncles all had identical, wordless responses to these questions: whenever he expressed curiosity about something, they would spank him raw.  They hoped this would make him less curious, but it never did.
One day the young elephant really really wants to know what crocodiles eat, and not receiving any helpful responses, travels and travels until he meets a crocodile in the river, who does not spank him, but gently lures him in close with promises to whisper the answer in his ear.
Then the crocodile tries to eat the elephant, but only catches him by the nose.  In the struggle, it’s stretched out to its present size, and the young elephant barely escapes with his life, along with a terribly painful and hideous new nose.
Crucially, the story doesn’t end there.
After some time of feeling terrible pain, and sorry for himself, and shame of his new appendage, with the wisdom of a helpful python (who also helped pull him out of the river), the elephant realizes that he can actually use it to do all manner of useful things.
So, naturally, he goes back home and spanks the shit out of his entire extended family.
Then the other elephants all go repeat this process and come back with new noses, and no one spanks anyone else anymore.  A trunked society is a polite society.
It ends with this poem:

I Keep six honest serving-men:    (They taught me all I knew)Their names are What and Where and When    And How and Why and Who.I send them over land and sea,    I send them east and west;But after they have worked for me,    I give them all a rest.
I let them rest from nine till five.    For I am busy then,As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,    For they are hungry men:But different folk have different views:    I know a person small—She keeps ten million serving-men,    Who get no rest at all!She sends ‘em abroad on her own affairs,    From the second she opens her eyes—One million Hows, two million Wheres,    And seven million Whys!

The “she” in the poem is Kipling’s daughter, to whom the entire book is more or less directly addressed, and who he apparently wanted to remain curious, to learn things for herself, to recover from adversity with new strengths, and to be deeply disrespectful of her unhelpful and unimaginative elders.
Not every story is equally subversive (The Butterfly that Stamped is basically about keeping bitches in line), but on average, like I said, pretty good.  Worth keeping around.
