title: I understand why the attention is on families like us. We are the vanguard
  of sexual equality and feminist action. Deeply privileged white people who recycle,
  shop at Wholefoods, vote for Obama and agree with the drone program should be who
  this country looks towards when assessing the success or failure of feminism. I
  did my degree in Women’s Studies and I’m a white woman, so I know that feminism,
  as a predominantly white middle class movement, is what me and my friends make it.
  And we’ve decided that there is nothing wrong with adhering to traditional gender
  roles. If you’re not a stay at home Mother, feeling the calm and control that comes
  with that self-defined role and the security of a six figure male-earned income,
  then maybe it’s time for you to question the opportunities and choices you’ve made
  in your own life, rather than judging ours.
