title: Hitchens was human trash, and his corpse should be interred in a grave worthy
  of his towering legacy — an eternally burning garbage fire, rising as high as a
  Baghdad sunrise, a smoky immolation of all the worthlessness that could be crammed

Hitchens was human trash, and his corpse should be interred in a grave worthy of his towering legacy — an eternally burning garbage fire, rising as high as a Baghdad sunrise, a smoky immolation of all the worthlessness that could be crammed in his “contrarian” paunch.—General Rehavam Ze’evi delivers a deliciously excoriative eulogy in Burn in Hell, Christopher Hitchens, on Et tu, Mr Destructo.
