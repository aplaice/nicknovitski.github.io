Kickstarter - Kris and Scott''s Scott and Kris ShowKris Straub and Scott Kurtz each make moderately funny webcomics (Starslip and PvP, respectively), but for some reason, when they got together to make Blamimations, I found the results consistently hilarious.  It was a no-brainer to pay them for that past entertainment, but if I can also get them to produce even more amusement in the future, my decision is over-determined!
