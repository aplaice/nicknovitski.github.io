YOU ARE IN CONTROL - Global GuerrillasI found this article in my inbox with the _followup tag.  I had shared it with myself, along with the note: “make this guy the villain of a story”
Not that I think Robb is a villain, of course.  His writing just reminds me so much of the kind of technothriller I’ve literally only seen in my dreams.  Rainbow Six meets Fight Club, written by the mutant offspring of Peter Watts and Cormac McCarthy.
Which is indeed why I started to write a couple of things like that, but I need to upgrade my processes before anything can come of them.
