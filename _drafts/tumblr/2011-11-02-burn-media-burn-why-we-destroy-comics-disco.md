Burn, media, burn! Why we destroy comics, disco records, and TVsDD Night had a specific objective—fans would come to the stadium and trash disco records. Those who arrived with the content in question would be admitted for 98 cents. The legendary event took place during a contest between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers.
"That evening over 70,000 people descended upon the ballpark," Echols writes. "So many Dahlites showed up with records—reportedly 10,000—that regular ticket holders were denied admission."

During the intermission, Dahl, who was decked out in military fatigues and an army helmet, drove onto the field in a military-style jeep. Next to him sat a blond bombshell, a model named Lorelei who often appeared in WLUP’s ads. Then an enormous crate filled with what was said to be 50,000 disco records was placed in center field. After setting off fireworks in front of the crate, Dahl detonated a fireworks bomb inside the crate that sent shards of the exploded records flying.

This provoked a half hour riot, with 7,000 fans prancing about the field of combat in an orgy of record smashing. Eventually the tactical division of the Chicago Police Department was called in. They arrested 39 people. Several were injured in the melee.
