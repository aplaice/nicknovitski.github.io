title: Unbelieving conservatives from Plato to Kristol have lamented the political
  consequences of other people’s unbelief. It’s an old number, now played out. It
  is possible to respect those who doggedly defend one or another traditional, supernatural
  religion, in all its theological rigor. Likewise those who bravely attempt to stammer
  out the first terms of a new (or recover the lost fragments of an old) non-supernatural
  religion, well aware that they will probably sound foolish. But those who merely
  want the rest of us to accept discipline and obey authority, whatever we believe
  (they don’t really care) deserve no respect.

Click through if you you want to know just how full of shit Irving Kristol (and by extension, neoconservatism) really is.
