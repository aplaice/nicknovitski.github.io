Antisec hits private intel firm; millions of docs allegedly lifted
The Antisec wing of Anonymous revealed on Saturday that it had compromised the servers of the private intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting Inc.—allegedly seizing millions of internal documents and thousands of credit card numbers from the company, more commonly known as Stratfor.
That would be a major breach of private information from any firm. But this hack could prove particularly significant, because Stratfor serves as an information-gathering resource and open source intelligence analysis for both the US military and for major corporations.

I talk a lot of shit about Daniel Suarez’s Daemon/Freedom bilogy, but I’ll admit that it “predicted” this successfully.
