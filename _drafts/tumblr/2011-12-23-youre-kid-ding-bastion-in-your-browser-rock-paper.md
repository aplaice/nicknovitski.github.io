You’re Kid-ding: Bastion In Your Browser | Rock, Paper, Shotgun
OK, Google’s Chrome browser just officially became scary/magnificent.

I knew the games would definitely make people sit up and take notice of Native Client, but I assumed that the game which would kick off the festivities would be either Quake or an NES emulator.  Or, you know, any game that wasn’t many people’s pick of best of the year of this year.
There’s a lot of trends coming to a head here.  
Just looking at games, streaming games run in the browser could not only replace “big” MMOs, not only entirely reshape the ‘casual’ field, it could also hugely disrupt digital distribution (Steam et al), which seemed to be just getting settled down.  If I was Gabe Newell, I would have a five two-year plan.
And, of course, if I was an actual game developer of any kind, I would be furiously calculating how much targeting NaCl could save me in QA ($!), and DRM ($$!), and distributor fees, and cetera!  To say nothing of, you know, same-day world-wide all-platform releases. Ask Newell how that policy’s been working out for him (here’s a hint: $$$$!).  
And un a broader scope, it’s looking more and more like the year of unix on the desktop will be the year of desktop on the web.  After all, if you can do this with NaCl, what can’t you do?  ChromeOS can’t get here fast enough.
