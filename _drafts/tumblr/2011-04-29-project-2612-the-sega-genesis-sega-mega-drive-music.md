Project 2612 - The Sega Genesis/Sega Mega Drive Music Archive
Welcome to Project2612, your one and only source on the web for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive VGM soundtracks. Our mission is to provide you with the most accurate, non-waveform reproduction of Sega Genesis/Sega Mega Drive music to date, using the VGM format.
We currently have a total of 627 soundtrack sets, with every single known song (and even some hidden songs not used!) in these games.

Now all I need to do is upload them all to audiko.
