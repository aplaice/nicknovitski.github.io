title: People don’t go watch the Phoenix Suns play basketball because it’s a game
  designed by Dr. James Naismith. They don’t watch it or play it to experience it’s
  design. They go see basketball because it is beautiful to see talented people like
  Steve Nash play it beautifully, and they play it to perform declarations of self,
  such as ‘I can outmanoeuvre that guy’, or ‘I can do a lay-up’. And just as we recognize
  the great authors in the broadcast culture paradigm, we also recognize the great
  actors in the interactive culture paradigm.
