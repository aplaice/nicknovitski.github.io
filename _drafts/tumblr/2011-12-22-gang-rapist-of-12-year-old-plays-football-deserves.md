"Gang Rapist of 12-Year Old Plays Football, Deserves Our Sympathy" - SI.comFor me personally, the second-biggest problem with the new Google Reader-Google+ integration is that you can only share things which you “+1”, whereas I frequently have more complex positions on things I want to share.  Cf this disgusting horseshit right here.
But don’t think that the +ers did this out of foolish inexperience!  You see, if you oblige people to only link to things that they like, then those links correspond more closely to their genuine preferences, and so you can target advertising to them more accurately.  So it’s actually a pretty clever move, but the end result is that I’ll probably only post on Google+ when, like Facebook, I can set it to automatically import my blogs and twits.
