title: 'The normal pattern now is for all of our needs to be commercially mediated
  by a global, monolithic, totalitarian Consumerist state. Since this way of doing
  things is tremendously wasteful and inefficient, we are forced to spend all of our
  time slaving away to support the Consumerist state, leaving precious little time
  for consuming. And as resources run short, more and more of us are simply left out:
  our labor is not needed, and, with our spending ability evaporating, our options
  dwindle to a very few generally unpleasant ones.'
