The Anime isn’t selling at my local bookstore, it’s just taking up shelf space atm. What is the purpose behind mentioning another article, yet failing to link it?He mentions a valid problem in his editorial, and that is that it would seem the Japanese still don’t understand role playing at the base level. There are no Japanese RPGs because no one in forty years of gaming now has made one with any broad commercial appeal within the RPG gaming community.He mentions plot heavy RPGs and railroading as a major factor in the lack of appeal for existing videogame RPGs, derides cutscenes as distractions rather than tools to help the players better interact in the game itself, and laments the lack of freeform sandbox style play.The aesthetic of that Island culture is inhibiting the artistic development, especially in RPGs. Consider the Kabuki style of entertainment that is put on by professionals, (Not everyone can participate, only artistic professionals can), this theater also includes a passive audience, much in the same style as traditional western film, and both of these elements (also heavily infused into Manga and Anime) are the anti-thesis of what RPG gaming is all about, to wit;Everyone gets to participate in RPGs, there are no passive players (unless the player chooses to be).You don’t need to be a professional to play or to create new themes and stories.I’m not sure why you would want to limit your perception and presume that just because the editor speaks about this as only applying to videogames, you automatically should as well. Look Deeper!
[Ed: It doesn’t feel right to post this without explicitly confirming that there are, in fact, many PnP RPGs made in Japan.]
