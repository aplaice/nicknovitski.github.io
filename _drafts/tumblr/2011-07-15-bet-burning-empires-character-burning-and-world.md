BET: Burning Empires Character Burning and World Burning, in PythonBET is a skeleton of a framework for a program that should exist in a million different forms, for every single roleplaying game, available for free in the itunes store, or Facebook, or directly from a site the RPG publisher controls: “Make a character for our cool roleplaying game, get excited to play it, then follow this link to buy the book”
I think that there should be more and better ways to productively integrate laptops, smartphones and tablets into the face-to-face gaming experience, as well as more and better ways to automate the recording and sharing of roleplaying game sessions, and I hoped, when I was writing BET 4-6 years ago, that it could represent a tiny step in that direction.
Then I locked it away and didn’t show it to anyone.  DUMB.
