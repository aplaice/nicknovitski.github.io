  I can’t hear Steve Jobs mentioned without thinking of Bruce Sterling, and the first example he gave to explain one of his “categories of experience” of the future we live in:

  In Gothic High-Tech, you’re Steve Jobs. You’ve built an iPhone which is a brilliant technical innovation, but you also had to sneak off to Tennessee to get a liver transplant because you’re dying of something secret and horrible.

  Jobs is going to be more a symbol than a person pretty quickly, so best to get on that bandwagon early.
