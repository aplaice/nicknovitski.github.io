title: "What might it take to weather not mere “consumer revolts” (after all, you’ve
  spent a century learning how to break, smash, and crush those like the tiniest of
  obstacles, by mastering the art of “marketing warfare”, deploying grand “campaigns”
  full of “tactics” waged against “targets”) — but people actively, relentlessly,
  consistently self-organizing against you? Earth to the 157th floor: there’s not
  a trick in the tired, toxic arsenal of business as usual that’s going to help. And
  in fact, if you’ve followed me so far, I’d say: most of the tricks above are likely
  to throw gas on the flames of rebellion — not douse them. \n\nBecause, when, you
  think about it, they are tricks, mostly. And they’ve become commodities. Anyone
  with a few grand and zero imagination can buy all the above off the shelf instantaneously
  from literally scores of low-cost suppliers, consultancies, agencies, and freelancers.
  They are as predictable as the tides ad as obvious (and as obviously uninteresting)
  as a bad pick-up line. \n\nInstead, what it might take to survive and thrive in
  the face of the many insurgencies bubbling and boiling above — of which people power
  is really just one — is this. A searing passion to make a positive, tangible difference.
  The impertinence to question the status quo. A heaping bucketful of empathy. A sweep
  of vision that makes “five year plans” look like a daily laundry list. The resilience
  to weather the mightiest of storms. Deep creativity — the ability to do what your
  rivals think is not just impractical, but impossible. \n\nYou probably wouldn’t
  ask your customers to believe that Freddy Krueger was really a ballerina just because
  you asked him to wear a tutu and do a pirouette. Here’s my guess: in the 21st century,
  if you’re playing by the rules of industrial-age business and trying to dress them
  up with the saccharine sugar-coating of marketing as usual, that’s pretty much exactly
  the bet you’re making.  And it’s probably going to be worth about as much as a Dutch
  banker’s bonus."

Via Bruce Eckel.
So, in response to popular agitation, bailed out bankers in the netherlands are having their bonuses taxed at 100%.
Social networks - that is, software-based social networks with tools for continuous asynchronous contact and permanent memory of previous interaction, as opposed to the sporadic and forgetful ones we run on our biological hardware - reward companies that can present themselves as real people, rather than instruments for the avoidance of responsibility that enjoy some of the privileges of real people.  Everyone wants to feel valued, connected to the thing that they buy from, and to the other people who do the same.  If you can make yourself trustworthy, people will trust you.
And if not, they will destroy you.  They say the internet routes around damage, but that stops being true when humans are put in charge of it (rather than engineers), because catastrophe is entertaining.  Every customer interaction is a potential first-page result on reddit if it goes poorly enough.  Every year, more money concentrates in people who are accustomed to social news, so every year, that scenario becomes more potentially devastating.  It should already wake investors in the middle of the night, tremblingly checking under their pillows for horse-heads.
So trust will become more important.  Software memory will weigh against purely transactional ethics with and between businesses.  And that’s a lot like it already is when we deal with other real people!  Trust and cooperation (or at least the absence of their opposites) is vitally important, biologically important; cooperation is selected for!
Except when it isn’t.  We all know assholes who screwed people who trusted them and made out like bandits, right?  All they needed was to appear trustworthy.  So that’s what’s really selected for, that’s what you really need in life and business: the veneer of trustworthiness, rather than the real thing.
The trick is this: actually being trustworthy is the cheapest way to appear trustworthy.
It’s not always the most advantageous; the bandit from your anecdote (and I’ve known a few) probably did just fine for himself.  But he probably did that by cutting ties, moving to another city or country, by removing himself from the social network.
Heck, I bet they didn’t mind.  That’s why they call them “sociopaths.”  But following those footsteps will become more and more difficult for businesses to do.  By which I mean, it will become more and more suicidal, like going into bankruptcy, only worse, because every time someone types your name into google, they’ll get a page full of rage.
Unless social networks are controllable, not just amenable to influence, but well and truly controllable according to predictable patterns - two scenarios I can think of are people decide they don’t care about censorship and wholesale edits to their relationship data when the funders of their social network software say so, or if we suddenly invent a rigorous science of memetics - unless something like that happens, then businesses will be rewarded more and more for behaving like trustworthy people, and punished more and more for behaving like sociopaths.
It’s possible that businesses will have natural advantages at sociopathy that always make defecting a superior strategy…but I don’t believe that.  I think that they have natural disadvantages at cooperating, that make the formation of trust difficult and costly, and that has put downward pressure on the value of that strategy.  But I think that social network software (plus other software I should talk about) has the power to change that, to negate those disadvantages,
There will always be defectors, because there will always be some circumstances where defecting is a good strategy (in fact, it becomes better and better the fewer people do it, cf. The Invention of Lying).  Some corporations will inevitably be sociopathic.  
But not all, and fewer every year, if we have anything to say about it.
