What is a Flex Alert?
A Flex Alert is an urgent call to Californians to immediately conserve electricity and to shift demand to off-peak hours (after 6 p.m.). The Flex Alert campaign is an educational and emergency alert program that informs consumers about how and when to conserve electricity. The public awareness campaign is critical to achieving high levels of conservation during heat waves and other challenging grid conditions such as wildfires or when major power plant or power lines are unavailable.

Literally, “we predict brownouts becoming commonplace in the near future, but only have enough resources to make a website to ~raise awareness~.”
