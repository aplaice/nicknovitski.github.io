title: Banks, as presently constituted and managed, cannot be trusted to perform any
  publicly important function against the perceived interests of their staff. Today’s
  banks represent the incarnation of profit-seeking behavior taken to its logical
  limits, in which the only question asked by senior staff is not what is their duty
  or their responsibility, but what can they get away with.
