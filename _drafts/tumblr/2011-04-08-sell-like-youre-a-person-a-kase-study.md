I mentioned recently that I really wanted to talk to some of the more pessimistic speakers at a few  of the Wondercon panels about how possible it was for them to make money online, and that in one case, I was actually able to do so.  
So, while wandering around Wondercon, this past weekend, I saw Keith Knight - creator of the semi-autobiographical K Chronicles, at his table, and he gave me a hand-drawn flyer advertising a comedic slide-show he planned on running in a nearby club (North Beach, but I won’t name it) Sunday night.
Come the hour, I found him standing outside the locked door of said venue, looking distraught.  Apparently, a miscommunication had occurred somewhere in the telephone-game between him, a friend that was acting as a producer, and the spot’s manager, with the result that Keith and his audience had been expected Saturday, and now we had no location for a comedic slide-show.
So instead the six of us retired to a table at Spec’s and had a few beers and some cheese, while Keith passed around some original sketches and just talked to us whatever came to mind.  We introduced ourselves, and talked about LA, coffee, censorship,  cartoons that have influenced our lives…whatever we felt like.  
I want to say here that Keith wasn’t as I expected him.  It’s funny how much a cartoonist’s style can influence my impression of them.  He didn’t have the bug-eyed jaw-flapping energy of his drawings.  He seemed relaxed, soft-spoken, and even a bit introverted: when he spoke to us, his eyes fled ours.  He was that thoughtful, funny friend any of us would be lucky to have. 
So obviously, it was an amazing moment of “Connecting With Fans.”  We felt exclusive as all hell.  He even insisted that the first round was on him!  A couple of the attendees mentioned how big fans they were of Keith, how they knew about the event from his Facebook page, and they thought the revised event was even better than the original would have been.
But how can this make money?  Half of us were ready to buy a book from Keith right there, and now here I am, gushing about how great the guy is to anyone who will listen.  But how can interactions like this scale?  You can have small events once a week from here to kingdom come, wherever you happen to be in the country, selling books at every single one.  And how many of us spend more time in bars than on facebook, anyway?  (Besides me currently, I mean (I may have to make an entire series of posts: “Why $SocialNetworkName Sucks, and why you need to use it anyway”)) 
With these sorts of thoughts rushing through my head, it was probably inevitable that someone say something that tripped my floodgate, and I made what I hoped was a few brief and breezy points about making money online.
But maybe I said too much, because then Keith said he would like to talk to me about it more!  It was already too late for both of us that night, but he said that he was going to be at the Anarchist Book Fair this coming weekend, and I should drop by and see him there.  And I said I would!
Unfortunately!  I had forgotten that CodeConf was also this weekend, and my time was fully spoken for during the day.  If I’m really lucky, I’ll be able to meet up with him sometime in the evening, or talk online.  There’s few things I hate doing more than breaking promises to meet with people, but I always try honor social commitments as first-come first-served, even if I temporarily forget the actual first-come folks.
