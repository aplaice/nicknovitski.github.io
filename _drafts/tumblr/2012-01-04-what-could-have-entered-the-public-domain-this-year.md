What Could Have Entered the Public Domain This Year | Techdirt
The good folks at the Center for the Study of the Public Domain at Duke University put together a depressing list each year of what would have gone into the public domain under copyright law if the law prior to 1978 remained in effect. You can check out this year’s unfortunate list of works seized from the public in a retroactive one-sided renegotiation of the deal the copyright holders had with the public. These works should be in the public domain, and they’re not… and the public got nothing in exchange for having these works taken away from us. Pulling from their writeup, here are just a few of the works that I thought you might find interesting:
Rudolf Flesch’s Why Johnny Can’t Read: And What You Can Do About It 
J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Return of the King, the final installment in his Lord of Rings trilogy 
Michihiko Hachiya’s Hiroshima Diary: The Journal of a Japanese Physician, August 8–September 30, 1945, translated by Warner Wells, md 
Evelyn Waugh’s Officers and Gentlemen, the second book in his Sword of Honour trilogy 
C.S. Lewis’ The Magician’s Nephew, the sixth volume his The Chronicles of Narnia 
Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita 
Jerome Lawrence & Robert E. Lee’s play about the Scopes “Monkey Trial,” Inherit the Wind 
Isaac Asimov’s The End of Eternity 
Jack Finney’s The Body Snatchers 
Arthur C. Clarke’s Earthlight 
Elvis Presley’s first TV appearance (on Louisiana Hayride, March 5, 1955)
Episodes of “I Love Lucy” 
The first issue of William F. Buckley’s “National Review.” 
"The Seven Year Itch," directed by Billy Wilder; starring Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell 
"Lady and the Tramp," Walt Disney Productions’ classic animation 
Alfred Hitchcock’s “To Catch a Thief,” starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly 
Two of James Dean’s three major motion pictures: “East of Eden,” directed by Elia Kazan and co-starring Raymond Massey and Julie Harris; and “Rebel Without a Cause,” directed by Nicholas Ray and co-starring Natlie Wood, Sal Mineo, and Jim Backus
