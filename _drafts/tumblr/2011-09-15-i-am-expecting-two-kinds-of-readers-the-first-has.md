title: "I am expecting two kinds of readers. The first has no idea that all these
  things really happened, knows nothing about nineteenth-century literature, and might
  even have taken Dan Brown seriously. He or she should gain a certain sadistic satisfaction
  from what will seem a perverse invention—including the main character, whom I have
  tried to make the most cynical and disagreeable in all the history of literature.
  \n\nThe second, however, knows or senses that I am recounting things that really
  happened. The fact that history can be quite so devious may cause this reader’s
  brow to become lightly beaded with sweat. He will look anxiously behind him, switch
  on all the lights, and suspect that these things could happen again today. In fact,
  they may be happening in that very moment. And he will think, as I do: “They are
  among us…”"
