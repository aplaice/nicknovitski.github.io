You Have To Work Out To Get A Workout
  Have you seen that Planet Fitness ad, where the big dumb goon says “I lift things up and put them down,” over and over, like a big dumb goon? Ha, what a big dumb goon, right? What a mindless, repetitive, boring, lifestyle he has. He just lifts things up and puts them down. What an uncreative, inside-the box workout program he has, that big dumb goon. Just lifting, and putting down. Over and over again.
   
   GUESS WHAT THAT’S WHY HE’S A FUCKING MONSTER.
