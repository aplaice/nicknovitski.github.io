title: "And if I might for a moment trumpet! How much better is this amiable miniature
  than the Real Thing! Here is a homeopathic remedy for the imaginative strategist.
  Here is the premeditation, the thrill, the strain of accumulating victory or disaster–and
  no smashed nor sanguinary bodies, no shattered fine buildings nor devastated country
  sides, no petty cruelties, none of that awful universal boredom and embitterment,
  that tiresome delay or stoppage or embarrassment of every gracious, bold, sweet,
  and charming thing, that we who are old enough to remember a real modern war know
  to be the reality of belligerence. This world is for ample living; we want security
  and freedom; all of us in every country, except a few dull-witted, energetic bores,
  want to see the manhood of the world at something better than apeing the little
  lead toys our children buy in boxes. We want fine things made for\nmankind–splendid
  cities, open ways, more knowledge and power, and more and more and more–and so I
  offer my game, for a particular as well as a general end; and let us put this prancing
  monarch and that silly scare-monger, and these excitable “patriots,” and those adventurers,
  and all the practitioners of Welt Politik, into one vast Temple of War, with cork
  carpets everywhere, and plenty of little trees and little houses to knock down,
  and cities and fortresses, and unlimited soldiers–tons, cellars-full–and let them
  lead their own lives there away from us. \n\nMy game is just as good as their game,
  and saner by reason of its size. Here is War, done down to rational proportions,
  and yet out of the way of mankind, even as our fathers turned human sacrifices into
  the eating of little images and symbolic mouthfuls. For my own part, I am _prepared_.
  I have nearly five hundred men, more than a score of guns, and I twirl my moustache
  and hurl defiance eastward from my home in Essex across the narrow seas. Not only
  eastward. I would conclude this little discourse with one other disconcerting and
  exasperating sentence for the admirers and practitioners of Big War. I have never
  yet met in little battle any military gentleman, any captain, major, colonel, general,
  or eminent commander, who did not presently get into difficulties and confusions
  among even the elementary rules of the Battle. You have only to play at Little Wars
  three or four times to realise just what a blundering thing Great War must be.\n\nGreat
  War is at present, I am convinced, not only the most expensive game in the universe,
  but it is a game out of all proportion. Not only are the masses of men and material
  and suffering and inconvenience too monstrously big for reason, but–the available
  heads we have for it, are too small. That, I think, is the most pacific realisation
  conceivable, and Little War brings you to it as nothing else but Great War can do."

That, I think, is the most pacific realisation conceivable, and Little War brings you to it as nothing else but Great War can do.—H.G Wells, via a comment on a Rock, Paper, Shotgun article about the confusion a morally sensible person feels when playing war-entertainments.
I can count on one finger commercial games I have seen that even attempt to teach the lesson Wells believed his did.
