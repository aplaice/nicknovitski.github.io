Engineer spent workdays at movies, bars, and Air Force paid for it - LAtimes
He was paid simultaneously to work full time at two aerospace firms but rarely went to work, instead spending his days at bars, amusement parks and movie theaters, according to the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles.
One of his employers, Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, paid $2.5 million last week to settle Justice Department allegations that the company defrauded the Air Force for several years by billing for Hunter’s time when it knew he was rarely at work, the U.S. attorney’s office said Tuesday.
Hunter would occasionally show up at Aerospace in the morning and work for an hour before heading to his second job at Analytical Services & Materials Inc. — or out to have some fun, Assistant U.S. Atty. Howard Daniels said.

Defense contracting would be a joke if it wasn’t a crime.
