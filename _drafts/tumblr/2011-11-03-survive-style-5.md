Let’s just get this joke out of the way:
"More like A+!"
It might have hurt you to read that, and you might wish you could take it back, but I want you to know that life goes on, and we become better people by going with it.
Survive Style 5+ is a surreal comedy of loss, acceptance, and personal growth.  It is at times off-putting, solemn, mysterious and touching, but remains consistently funny.  It revels in patterns and repetitions, but then leaps into some truly glorious breaks with expectations
The story (hah!) follows the 5+ of the title.  There’s the couple, the advertising director, the trio of useless hoodlums, the average family, and the Vinnie Jones.
 
Vinnie plays mostly to type, which is pretty enjoyable, but what raises his scenes to a truly inspired level is that he’s followed around by my single favorite character, a nebbish who acts as his translator and (forgivably) gets a little too excited at the excuse to talk like facking Vinnie Jones to whoever crosses their shared path.
Actually, I should say that he’s my favorite human character, since this is one of those movies for whom the sets are also characters, and some of them are extremely effective ones.  My favorite is probably the house of the couple.  The two don’t talk much, so we never learn just how they got Tim Burton and Tim Gunn to do the decorating, or exactly what admixture of Schedule II substances they paid with, but at least we get to enjoy the result, and perhaps that’s enough.  
In short, watch this film.
