I've recently un-retired.

About a year ago, my career in software brought me to a degree of financial independence that enabled me to travel the world indefinitely.

I did that, and enjoyed it, until this past February.
As the first month of the Trump presidency progressed, I grew appalled, then ashamed, then annoyed.
By the end of that month, I had canceled all of my travel plans.

I'm now back in the US, working to join and build community power organizations and seek material justice in the Bay Area and beyond.

I'm available for consulting on Organization Design, especially for web-centric engineering companies, and for training sessions on the nix language and family of packaging and deployment tools.
