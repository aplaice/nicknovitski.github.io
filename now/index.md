title: what i'm focused on right now
---

Having reached my idiosyncratic personal finance goal of a "10 year emergency fund", I'm leaving my beloved job of the last 2 years (Braintree/Paypal) and my beloved home of the last 4 (the Bay Area) to travel the world while working on my own software projects, indefinitely.

At the moment, I'm  in the last stages of shrinking my worldly possessions down to a collection which can fit in [this backpack](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/laptop-bags/products/smart-alec).

I'll be leaving Oakland the 26th of July, and spending three months in Berlin.

When I regain my free time, the first idea I'll work on is the personal computer I've dreamed of for years: immortal, powerful, cheap, and run in the cloud.  I've seen them take off at a few companies now, and I think they're very much the future of development environments, but even if I'm wrong, I still want one for _myself_, so I can work on my next idea (probably something to help organizations of all sizes track and improve their governance).

I strongly suspect I'll also do a lot of work on this site, and maybe even start a mailing list. 

If you'd like to know more about any of the above, or if you have a problem you think I can help with, please do [email me](mailto:now@nicknovitski.com) about it.
