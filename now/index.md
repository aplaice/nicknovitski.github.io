About a year ago, having reached financial independence, I tried out early retirement.

Slow-but-continuous world travel was cheap, productive, and pleasant.
But the first few weeks of Donald Trump's presidency led me to cancel all my plans for the year and came back to the US.

Now I'm working to build community power and material justice in the Bay Area, California, the United States, and the world.

I also consult on Organizational Design, and give training sessions on Build and Site Reliability Engineering.
