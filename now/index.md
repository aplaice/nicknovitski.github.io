title: what i'm focused on right now
---

Having reached my idiosyncratic personal finance goal of a "10 year emergency fund", I'm leaving my beloved job of the last 2 years (Braintree/Paypal) and my beloved home of the last 4 (the Bay Area) to travel the world while working on my own software projects, indefinitely.

At the moment, I'm  in the last stages of shrinking my worldly possessions down to a collection which can fit in [this backpack](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/laptop-bags/products/smart-alec).

When I regain my free time, the first idea I'll work on is the personal computer I've dreamed of for years: immortal, powerful, cheap, and run in the cloud.  I've seen them take off at a few companies now, and I think they're very much the future of development environments, but even if I'm wrong, I still want one for _myself_, so I can work all my other ideas (probably starting with something to help organizations of all sizes track and improve their governance).

I'll be going to Berlin first.  I have a long enough list of places I want to see that I could fill several years of travel without repetition (though please, if you have a suggestion or invitation, let me know), but I want to see if, over, time, I'm able to make a semi-stable seasonal nomadic pattern.

I plan to write [a newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/nicknovitski); you can [subscribe to it](https://tinyletter.com/nicknovitski) if you'd like occasional personal updates.  I'll write on this blog as well, so if you want to know what I think in addition to what I'm doing, you can [subscribe to it too](/feed.xml).

If you'd like to know more about any of the above, or if you have a problem you think I can help with, please do [email me](mailto:now@nicknovitski.com) about it.
